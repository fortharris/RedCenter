RedCenter
=========

My way of cleaning viruses on drives.

Windows viruses have a way of staying hidden even when the show hidden files settings is on. RedCenter basically exposes every file in a directory including viruses so they can easily be dealt with. Additional information is provided to help you decide if a file is a virus or not, and also there exists a vault which houses all deleted files so they can easily be restored. Files in the vault are encrypted to avoid further virus detection by other antiviruses, as well as to prevent you from accidentally running them.

Requirements to run source:
PyWin32
Python 3
PyQt4
